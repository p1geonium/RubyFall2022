<h2>Boolean value</h2>
  
A ***boolean*** is a value used in a logic statement to say if something is considered true or false.
  
There are two boolean values in Ruby: ***true*** and ***false***
  
In a boolean context, or logical expression, everything is considered ***true*** except the two value:

    - false
    - nil
    
These two value are the **ONLY** values considered falsy.
